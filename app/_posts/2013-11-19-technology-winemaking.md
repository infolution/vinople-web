Hello to all. This is a blog about software and technology in winemaking business.

We are all deeply connected with technology in our lives, from the moment we wake up, during work hours, family hours, sleeping hours.

Technology helps us do our work more efficient, and we can do things that were'nt imaginable before.

Wine making is an old craft, dating from ancient history and it survived. Today it is a big business in lots of countries throughout the world.

Of course, technology is involved in winemaking very much. But still, it isn't taken over.
Technoloy involved in winemaking in these areas:

* automated presses
* temperature control systems
* automated maceration

It is very important that technology doesn't interfere with wine in a bad way, because wine making is a natural process.

My field of interest is software in winemaking. I've created an application Vinople that improves management of winery in different fileds.
I'll try to explain these fields in next posts, so stay tuned.
